[PHP] Twitch Interface

This is a universal PHP interface designed specifically to connect to the twitch.tv Kraken API servers to grab and put data.  It was designed with the intention of being very controlled, safe and light for both the user server and the Kraken API servers.  Almost, if not all capable calls are coded directly into the interface, allowing the interface to perform almost, if not all functions that the API allows.  Any functions that you believe need to be added or improved can be done via a pull request.

Currently this interface supports all V3 API calls.
