Installing the interface is as easy as including the file <code>twitch_interface.php</code> (or whatever you have renamed it to) into the execution.  This can be done in 2 ways and both are valid.

1.  
```php  
include('root/twitch_interface.php');
```  

2.  
```php
require('root/twitch_interface.php');
```
